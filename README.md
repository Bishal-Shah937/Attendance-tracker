## Project Description
The Attendance Verification System leverages blockchain technology to manage and reward student attendance. The smart contract allows instructors to mark student attendance and enables students to claim rewards based on their attendance records. The system aims to incentivize regular attendance and maintain an immutable record of student presence.

## Key Features
- **Mark Attendance:** Instructors can mark attendance for students, recording their presence on the blockchain.
- **Claim Rewards:** Students can claim rewards based on the number of attendance records they have.
- **Adjust Reward Amount:** The contract owner can update the reward amount per attendance record.
- **Security:** Ensures that each student can only claim rewards once and prevents unauthorized access through owner-only functions.
- **Fund Management:** Allows the contract owner to withdraw excess funds and manage the contract balance.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to enhance the transparency and accountability of attendance tracking in educational institutions. By utilizing blockchain technology, the system ensures a tamper-proof record of attendance and provides a transparent method for rewarding students. This initiative aims to promote better attendance and provide an innovative solution to traditional attendance tracking challenges.

##Contract Address:
The Smart contract is deployed at the following address on the Etherum Blockchain:
